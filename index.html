  <h3>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h3>
  <p>WWW (or www) is an initialism for World Wide Web. In English, WWW is the longest possible three-letter abbreviation when spoken,
    requiring six to nine syllables, depending on how it is pronounced, whereas the twelve letters in "World Wide Web" are pronounced with three syllables.
    The English writer Douglas Adams once quipped:
    The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for.</p>

  <p>— Douglas Adams, The Independent on Sunday, 1999</p>
